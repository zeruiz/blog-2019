### Background

The internet may not be [a series of tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes), but it is made up of a number of different programming and markup languages. It is useful to develop a basic vocabulary and understanding of these languages before attempting to interact with (messy) data stored on the internet.

As the reading material for this week, you are asked to read through a set of websites on XML and HTML and navigating through them:

- **XML (eXtensible Markup Language):**
XML is a generic markup framework. Many different common file types are based on or related to XML structure (for instance, .docx, .xlsx, .html) <bR>
Read the following sections of w3schools.com's Introduction to XML:

    - [XML Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp)
    - [XML How to Use](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_usedfor.asp)
    - [XML Tree](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_tree.asp)
    - [XML Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_syntax.asp)
    - [XML Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_elements.asp)
    - [XML Attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_attributes.asp)

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** HTML focuses on the display of information in a document format. XML is a much more general framework, but most of the concepts (tags, attributes, elements) apply directly to HTML. Open up the [w3schools HTML page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and read the introduction, then look through a few topics in the tutorial that interest you. 

- **Navigation: HTML, CSS, XPATH, and more:** In many situations, it is helpful to be able to pick out specific parts of an HTML or XML file - for example, a table with useful data. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) Selectors and XPATH are two methods commonly used to identify specific nodes in HTML or XML documents. 

    - [XPATH Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp)
    - [CSS Selector Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)

**Write a blog post answering the following questions and detailing the progress: **

1. The `xml2` R package can be used to work with xml files. Write a function, `current_weather` that accepts a 4-letter airport code (KAMW in the URL here: https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KAMW.xml) and returns a data frame with the airport location (station ID, latitude, longitude), last update time, and current weather information (temperature, weather condition, wind speed and direction) at that airport. The `xml2` functions `read_xml`, `xml_children`, `xml_name`, and `xml_text` will be useful. Remember to handle errors and check inputs, and make sure to return a data frame with appropriate data types.
```{r}
library(xml2)
library(tidyverse)
library(testthat)

current_weather =function(name){
  link = paste0("https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/", name, ".xml")
  
  assertthat::assert_that(is.character(link), msg = "link should be a string!")
  file = read_xml(link)
  colname = xml_name(xml_children(file))
  len = length(colname)
  text = xml_text(xml_children(file))
  data = as.data.frame(matrix(text, nrow=1, ncol=len, byrow = T), stringsAsFactors = F)
  
  if(!is.data.frame(data)|is.null(dim(data))){warning("please check data again.")}
  
  colnames(data)=colname
  df = data %>% dplyr::select(station_id, latitude, longitude, observation_time, 
                      weather, temperature_string, wind_dir, wind_mph)
  
  expect_s3_class(df, "data.frame")
  return(df)
}
current_weather("KAMW")

```

2. Which HTML tags did you investigate? Describe how to format at least 3 separate pieces of a document using HTML tags.

### I find heading, paragraph, and image.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>I hope Ames will become warmer in the following days.</p>

<p style="background-color:Tomato;">
Let's have a BBQ tomorrow!
</p>

</body>
</html>

3. Compile this Rmarkdown document to HTML, then open the HTML file in a web browser. Open the inspector console for your browser (Ctrl-Shift-I in Chrome, Ctrl-Shift-C in Firefox) and look at the HTML code corresponding to various parts of the document. <br>
Answer the following questions:

  - What types of tags did you find? 
    I found head, body and so on.
  - How are code chunks formatted in HTML?
    code chunks are formatted in a container of style "R" with a \<pre: class = "r"> tag.
  - What differences are there in the HTML markup for R code chunks and R output blocks?
    code chunks have class = "r" in the "pre" tags(have colors), while  R output blocks do not have.
    
4. In R, the `rvest` package, which is part of the tidyverse, makes it (relatively) easy to pull specific pieces from structured documents. The `html_nodes` function selects nodes using either xpath or css, and additional functions such as `html_attrs`, `html_text`, and `html_table` pull information out of the markup text.<br>
Choose a Wikipedia page that has at least one image to test the `rvest` package out
```{r}
library(rvest)
library(magrittr)
library(magick)

link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon"
link2=read_html(link)
node = html_nodes(link2, "table.infobox")

text=html_text(node)

table2=html_table(node, header=F) 
table2 %>% pander::pander()

b=link2 %>% html_node("img") %>% html_attr("src")
url=paste0("http:",b) 
d=url%>% image_read() %>% image_trim()
d

```
