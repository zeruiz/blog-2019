Write a function, current_weather that accepts a 4-letter airport code (KAMW in the URL here: https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KAMW.xml) and returns a data frame with the airport location (station ID, latitude, longitude), last update time, and current weather information (temperature, weather condition, wind speed and direction) at that airport. 
```{r}
library(xml2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(assertthat)
current_weather <-function(code){
  
url<-paste0("https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/",code,".xml")
xml <-read_xml(url) 

assert_that(nchar(code) == 4,is.character(code))


#xml <-read_xml("https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KAMW.xml") 
names<-xml_contents(xml)%>%xml_name()  
content<-  xml%>%xml_children()%>%xml_text
df <- as.data.frame(matrix(content, ncol = length(content), byrow = T), stringsAsFactors = F)
colnames(df) <- names
airport_info<-df[which(colnames(df)%in% c("station_id","latitude","longitude","observation_time","weather","temperature_string","wind_dir","wind_mph"))]
return(airport_info)

assert_that(
    is.data.frame(airport_info), # Check input is a data frame
    not_empty(airport_info) # Check that df has at least one row and column
  )

}

#example
current_weather("KAMW")
```

Compile this Rmarkdown document to HTML, then open the HTML file in a web browser. Open the inspector console for your browser (Ctrl-Shift-I in Chrome, Ctrl-Shift-C in Firefox) and look at the HTML code corresponding to various parts of the document.
Answer the following questions:

  What types of tags did you find?
    The <p> tag defines a paragraph.
    The <pre> tag defines preformatted text.
    The <code> tag is a phrase tag. It defines a piece of     computer code. 
    The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an      HTML document.
    The <script> tag is used to define a client-side         script (JavaScript).
    
    
    How are code chunks formatted in HTML?
    
    with <pre class="r">

    What differences are there in the HTML markup for R code chunks and R output blocks?
this is for code chunk
    <pre class="r">
    <code class="h1js">
    <span class..</span>
    ....
    ....
    ...
    </code>
this is for R output block
    </pre>
     <code class="h1js"> </code>
    </pre>
seems that R code chunk has class="r"
    
rvest package, which is part of the tidyverse, makes it (relatively) easy to pull specific pieces from structured documents. The html_nodes function selects nodes using either xpath or css, and additional functions such as html_attrs, html_text, and html_table pull information out of the markup text.
Choose a Wikipedia page that has at least one image to test the rvest package out
```{r}
library(rvest)
library(purrr)
html <-read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz")
t<-html%>%html_nodes(".infobox")%>%html_table()%>% flatten %>% map_dfr(data.frame)
#html%>%html_nodes(".image") %>% html_attr("alt")

```
