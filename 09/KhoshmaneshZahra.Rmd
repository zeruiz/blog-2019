1. The `xml2` R package can be used to work with xml files. Write a function, `current_weather` that accepts a 4-letter airport code (KAMW in the URL here: https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KAMW.xml) and returns a data frame with the airport location (station ID, latitude, longitude), last update time, and current weather information (temperature, weather condition, wind speed and direction) at that airport. The `xml2` functions `read_xml`, `xml_children`, `xml_name`, and `xml_text` will be useful. Remember to handle errors and check inputs, and make sure to return a data frame with appropriate data types. 

```{r}
library(xml2)
library(tidyverse)
current_weather <- function(code){
  # check input, whether code is avilable
  checkmate::assertCharacter(code)
   ## check code is charachter and 4 charachters
  if(!is.character(code)){
    stop('the code is not character')
  }
  
  if(nchar(code) != 4){
    stop("The code must have 4 characters!")
  }
  weatherData <- read_xml(paste0("https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/",code,".xml")) %>%
    xml_children() %>%
    xml_text() %>%
    .[c(7,8,9,11,14,18,20)] %>%
    t() %>%
    data.frame() %>%
    setNames(c("stationID","lat","long","lastUpdate","temp(F)","windDirection","windSpeed(MPH)"))
  
  #check output is dataframe
  checkmate::assertDataFrame(weatherData,types = c("numeric", "factor"), min.rows = 1, col.names = "named")
  weatherData
}
current_weather("KAMW")

```


2. Which HTML tags did you investigate? Describe how to format at least 3 separate pieces of a document using HTML tags.

* css Style: use to format the document, here set blue color to background color and blue color to header text and red to paragraph text

<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>

* header and paragraph: <h> tag is for setting a header. h1 is larger size and h5 is smaller size.

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

* CSS Border
p {
  border: 1px solid powderblue;
}

* Hyperlinks
<a href="url">link text</a>
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>

* image
<img src="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/ca/5ca00daf-81a6-5e26-bff3-25ea003d8f4e/4f9054fbddfae.image.jpg" alt="Cute Chimpanzee">

* table
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th> 
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> tom</td>
    <td>Smith</td> 
    <td>20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sara</td>
    <td>Jackson</td> 
    <td>48</td>
  </tr>
</table>



3. Compile this Rmarkdown document to HTML, then open the HTML file in a web browser. Open the inspector console for your browser (Ctrl-Shift-I in Chrome, Ctrl-Shift-C in Firefox) and look at the HTML code corresponding to various parts of the document. <br>
Answer the following questions:
    - What types of tags did you find?
    
      * head, body, style, script, div,color ,font
      
      * line, height and width , margin , padding
    
    - How are code chunks formatted in HTML?
       *  R code chunks are with pre class="r" tags. The actual text is stored within a span class="hljs" tag.
    - What differences are there in the HTML markup for R code chunks and R output blocks?
       * Code output blocks are stored in a pre tag and the text in another code class="hljs" tag.
    
4. In R, the `rvest` package, which is part of the tidyverse, makes it (relatively) easy to pull specific pieces from structured documents. The `html_nodes` function selects nodes using either xpath or css, and additional functions such as `html_attrs`, `html_text`, and `html_table` pull information out of the markup text.<br>
Choose a Wikipedia page that has at least one image to test the `rvest` package out

```{r}
library(rvest)
spring <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(season)")
html_node(spring,"img") %>% 
  xml_attr(attr="src") %>%
  paste0("https:",.) %>%
  magick::image_read()
html_nodes(spring,"table")[1] %>%
  html_attr("class")
html_nodes(spring,"table")[1] %>%
html_table()
```
