1. The xml2 R package can be used to work with xml files. Write a function, current_weather that accepts a 4-letter airport code (KAMW in the URL here: https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KAMW.xml) and returns a data frame with the airport location (station ID, latitude, longitude), last update time, and current weather information (temperature, weather condition, wind speed and direction) at that airport. The xml2 functions read_xml, xml_children, xml_name, and xml_text will be useful. Remember to handle errors and check inputs, and make sure to return a data frame with appropriate data types.
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(xml2)
```

```{r}
current_weather <- function(code) {
#' This function takes in 4-letter airport code and returns information on
#' airport location, current weather and last update time.
#'
#' @author  stat_cat
#' @param   code 4-letter string
#' @return  info data frame with information on airport and current weather
#' @export  current_weather
    # check if code is string
    checkmate::assert_character(code)
    
    # declare path
    path <- paste("https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/", 
                  code, ".xml", sep = "")
    # extract xml from path
    xml <- read_xml(path)
    
    # from examining xml children, we extract only specific attributes
    # extract character typed variable
    text_ch <- xml_text(xml_children(xml))[c(7,10,12,13,18)]
    # extract double typed variable
    text_dbl <- xml_double(xml_children(xml))[c(8,9,20)]
    # combine into one
    info <- data.frame(attribute = c(text_ch, text_dbl), 
                       row.names = c("station ID",
                                     "last update time",
                                     "weather condition",
                                     "temperature",
                                     "wind direction",
                                     "lattitude",
                                     "longitude",
                                     "wind speed"))
    # check if info is data frame
    checkmate::checkDataFrame(info)
    
    return(info)
}
```

Here I used to my function to extract weather information for international aiport in San Jose, California:
```{r, warning = FALSE}
current_weather("KSJC")
```

2. Which HTML tags did you investigate? Describe how to format at least 3 separate pieces of a document using HTML tags.

 I want to share tags by the following examples: (note that since we defined thhe output of .rmd to be html, this file accepts html tags directly, i.e we don't have to include document type declaration, html and body tags)
<br>
<h1>It's a HUGE heading!</h1>
<a href = "https://kgulzina.github.io/">link to my website</a>
<br>
<p style="font-family:courier;">Here is the picture of my favorite cat:</p>
<img src = "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/08/arts/08PETS/08PETS-superJumbo-v2.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp">

3. Compile this Rmarkdown document to HTML, then open the HTML file in a web browser. Open the inspector console for your browser (Ctrl-Shift-I in Chrome, Ctrl-Shift-C in Firefox) and look at the HTML code corresponding to various parts of the document. 
Answer the following questions:

- What types of tags did you find?
 <p style="font-family:courier;">Tags which I noticed, or at least could differentiate were: head, body and html document tags. Also, there are a lot of script and style tags.</p>
- How are code chunks formatted in HTML?
 <p style="font-family:courier;">Code chunks are formatted by &lt;code&gt; tag with class = "hljs" attribute, which are within parent &lt;pre&gt; tag with class = "r" as an attribute.</p>
- What differences are there in the HTML markup for R code chunks and R output blocks?
 <p style="font-family:courier;">While both are contained within parent tag &lt;pre&gt; with class = "r", code chunks are within &lt;code&gt; tag and output blocks are simply in &lt;pre&gt; tag without any specific attribute.</p>

4. In R, the rvest package, which is part of the tidyverse, makes it (relatively) easy to pull specific pieces from structured documents. The html_nodes function selects nodes using either xpath or css, and additional functions such as html_attrs, html_text, and html_table pull information out of the markup text.
Choose a Wikipedia page that has at least one image to test the rvest package out.
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(rvest)
```

```{r}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ballack"
html <- read_html(url)

# extract the bigoraphical data
html %>% html_nodes(".vcard") %>% html_text(trim = TRUE) -> ballack
ballack[1] %>% strsplit("\n")

## I could clean up more, but for this moment it's seems to take a lot of time

```
